                My name is Andrew Rodriguez; I first started my journey at Weber State close to three years ago now but due to personal reasons along with various obstacles I've had to face led to me making the decision to take a break from school. This is my first semester back from my hiatus and l'm excited to make up for all the time l've lost. I'd also like to think that I'm open minded since l'm into a lot of different activities such as sports, reading, having fun with friends, watching movies etc. The reason that I'm taking this course is because I want to raise my proficiency with Html, CSS and Javascript along with learning more about the intricacies associated with web development to a greater capacity. With this portfolio I strive to demonstrate all of the skills and knowledge that I will have attained throughout this course.
